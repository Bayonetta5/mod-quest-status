[English](README.md) | [Espa√±ol](README_ES.md)


## What is the module for?

It aims to assist the players, who eliminate quests and then don't know where in the chain they stayed. Focused mainly on reputational chains. You can make a macro with all the missions of a chain and inspect the player to know which one is missing.
